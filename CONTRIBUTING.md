## Feature Evaluation Framework

| Category              | Ask This...                                    | ‚úÖ Accept if...                                 | ‚ùå Reject if...                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Security Impact**   | Does it maintain security standards?           | Implements proper auth, validation, sanitization | Introduces vulnerabilities or weaknesses   |
| **Performance**       | Will it scale to production loads?             | Efficient algorithms, resource management      | Memory leaks, blocking operations          |
| **API Consistency**   | Does it follow existing patterns?              | Matches current endpoint structure, naming     | Creates new patterns unnecessarily         |
| **Error Handling**    | How does it handle failures?                   | Graceful degradation, clear error messages     | Crashes, unclear errors, silent failures   |
| **Documentation**     | Is usage clear and complete?                   | Full API docs, examples, edge cases covered    | Missing or unclear documentation           |
| **Testing**           | Has it been properly tested?                   | Unit tests, integration tests, load tested     | No tests or insufficient coverage          |
| **Value**             | Does it solve a real problem?                  | Reduces costs, improves efficiency             | Edge case, limited use, low impact         |

## Technical Guidelines

> These guidelines help maintain a clean and production-ready project.

### üîí Security Requirements

* **Input Validation** - Validate all user inputs
* **Authentication** - Use API key authentication where required
* **Sanitization** - Clean all file paths and user data
* **Error Messages** - Don't expose sensitive information

### üß† Code Style

* Use **clear, descriptive names** (e.g., `process_media_file`, not `pmf`)
* Add comprehensive error handling with proper logging
* Include docstrings for all functions and classes
* Follow PEP 8 for Python code
* Use type hints where applicable


### üßº Clean Contributions

* Run tests before submitting (`pytest`)
* Check Docker image size impact
* Remove all debug code and console logs
* Update requirements.txt only with necessary packages
* Include unit tests for new features
* Update API documentation for new endpoints
* Ensure backwards compatibility

## Branch Naming Conventions

All contributions should follow this process:

1. Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/bmurrtech/sync-scribe-studio)
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/sync-scribe-studio.git
   cd sync-scribe-studio
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/bmurrtech/sync-scribe-studio.git
   ```
4. Create your feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```
5. Name your feature branch following these patterns:
   * For bug fixes: `fix/descriptive-bug-name`
   * For new features: `feature/descriptive-feature-name`
   * For documentation: `docs/descriptive-change`

Example:
```bash
# For a new feature
git checkout -b feature/advanced-media-processing

# For a bug fix
git checkout -b fix/s3-upload-timeout

# For security updates
git checkout -b security/api-rate-limiting
```

6. After making your changes, run tests and push:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   
   # Push to your fork
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```
   Then create a pull request targeting the `main` branch.

## Final Thoughts üöÄ

* **Security First** - Every feature must maintain our security standards
* **Production Ready** - Code should be tested and ready for deployment
* **Well Documented** - Clear documentation helps everyone
* **Performance Matters** - Optimize for scale and efficiency

Thank you for contributing to Sync Scribe Studio API! Together we're building a powerful, cost-effective alternative to expensive API services.
