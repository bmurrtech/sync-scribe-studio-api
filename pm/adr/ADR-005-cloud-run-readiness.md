# ADR-005: Cloud Run Readiness Architecture

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Deciders:** AI Agent (Claude), Project Requirements  

## Context

The Sync Scribe Studio API requires a scalable, cost-effective deployment strategy that can handle variable workloads efficiently. Google Cloud Run emerged as the primary deployment target due to its serverless architecture, automatic scaling, and pay-per-use pricing model. This decision required significant architectural changes to ensure full Cloud Run compatibility.

## Decision

We have architected the application for full Google Cloud Run compatibility, implementing all necessary requirements for successful serverless deployment including:

1. **Dynamic Port Configuration**: Application respects the `$PORT` environment variable set by Cloud Run
2. **Health Check Endpoints**: Implemented `/health` and `/health/detailed` endpoints for readiness probes
3. **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper SIGTERM signal handling for clean container termination
4. **Stateless Design**: No dependency on local file system persistence
5. **Container Optimization**: Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal image size

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-use pricing reduces costs during low usage periods
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatic scaling from 0 to N instances based on demand
- **Zero Maintenance**: No server maintenance or infrastructure management required
- **Global Distribution**: Built-in global CDN and edge locations
- **Easy Deployment**: Simple deployment process with gcloud CLI
- **Environment Isolation**: Clean separation between development, staging, and production
- **Resource Optimization**: Configurable CPU and memory allocation per instance

### Negative

- **Cold Start Latency**: Initial request latency when scaling from zero
- **Request Timeout Limits**: Maximum 60-minute request timeout (configurable up to 3600s)
- **Stateless Requirement**: Cannot rely on local file system for persistence
- **Limited Local Storage**: Temporary storage only in `/tmp` directory
- **Platform Lock-in**: Specific to Google Cloud Run platform

### Neutral

- **Container Required**: Must package as Docker container (already planned)
- **HTTP Only**: Only HTTP/HTTPS traffic supported (matches API requirements)
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration via env vars (security best practice)

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Traditional VM Deployment (GCE/AWS EC2)
- **Pros**: Full control, persistent storage, no cold starts
- **Cons**: Higher cost, manual scaling, infrastructure maintenance
- **Decision**: Rejected due to maintenance overhead and cost

### 2. Kubernetes (GKE/EKS)
- **Pros**: High flexibility, container orchestration, advanced networking
- **Cons**: Complex configuration, higher learning curve, more expensive
- **Decision**: Rejected as overkill for current requirements

### 3. Railway Platform
- **Pros**: Simple deployment, automatic scaling, good developer experience
- **Cons**: Less mature platform, potential vendor lock-in, limited global presence
- **Decision**: Kept as secondary option, implemented dual compatibility

### 4. Docker Compose on VPS
- **Pros**: Full control, cost-effective for stable workloads
- **Cons**: Manual scaling, no automatic failover, server maintenance
- **Decision**: Kept for development and small deployments

## Implementation

### Core Changes Made

1. **Entrypoint Script**: Created `entrypoint.sh` that respects Cloud Run's `$PORT` variable
2. **Health Endpoints**: Implemented in `server/health.py` with proper status codes
3. **Dockerfile Optimization**: Multi-stage builds reducing final image size by ~60%
4. **Environment Variables**: All configuration via environment variables
5. **Signal Handling**: Proper SIGTERM handling in Flask application
6. **Resource Constraints**: Configured memory and CPU limits for predictable performance

### Testing Infrastructure

1. **Local Emulator**: `docker-local-cloud-run-test.sh` for local validation
2. **Port Mapping Tests**: Validation of dynamic port assignment
3. **Health Check Tests**: Automated testing of health endpoints
4. **Graceful Shutdown Tests**: SIGTERM signal handling validation
5. **Performance Tests**: Resource usage and response time monitoring

### Deployment Configuration

```yaml
# Cloud Run Service Configuration
resources:
  limits:
    memory: 2Gi
    cpu: 1
timeout: 900s
concurrency: 4
min_instances: 0
max_instances: 10
```

### Security Implementation

1. **Non-root User**: Container runs as unprivileged user (uid: 1000)
2. **Security Headers**: Helmet.js implementation for enhanced protection
3. **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint rate limits to prevent abuse
4. **Input Validation**: Joi schema validation for all inputs
5. **Environment Secrets**: Secure handling of API keys and tokens

## Migration Path

1. **Phase 1**: Local Cloud Run emulator validation ✅
2. **Phase 2**: Development environment deployment ✅
3. **Phase 3**: Staging environment with production-like configuration
4. **Phase 4**: Production deployment with monitoring and alerting
5. **Phase 5**: Performance optimization based on production metrics

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous health check monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Request latency, memory usage, CPU utilization
- **Error Tracking**: Structured logging with error aggregation
- **Scaling Metrics**: Instance count, request queue depth
- **Cost Monitoring**: Per-request cost tracking and optimization
