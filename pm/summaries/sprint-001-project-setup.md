# Sprint 001: Project Setup Summary

**Date:** January 2025  
**Sprint Goal:** Complete initial project structure setup and repository organization  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  

## Key Accomplishments

### Repository Restructuring
- [x] Moved all files from `no-code-architects-toolkit/` subfolder to root directory
- [x] Removed empty subfolder after successful migration
- [x] Preserved all existing project files and git history

### PM Documentation Framework
- [x] Created comprehensive `/pm/` folder structure:
  - `/pm/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
  - `/pm/summaries/` - Sprint and development summaries  
  - `/pm/PRDs/` - Product Requirements Documents
  - `/pm/snippets/` - Reusable code samples
  - `/pm/actions/` - User task tracking
- [x] Moved existing PRD to proper location `/pm/PRDs/PRD.md`
- [x] Created ADR template for future architectural decisions

### Environment Configuration
- [x] Updated `.env.example` with all required environment variables:
  - OpenAI API configuration
  - Railway deployment URLs (staging/production)
  - Database authentication token
  - Application settings
  - Optional feature flags

### Project Documentation
- [x] Created comprehensive `ROADMAP.md` with:
  - Project overview and timeline
  - Current and upcoming development phases
  - Team roles and responsibilities
  - Architecture decision tracking
  - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Task Management
- [x] Established user to-do list in `/pm/actions/user_to-do.md`
- [x] Categorized tasks by environment setup, testing, documentation, deployment, and security

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
- `.env.example` - Updated with project-specific environment variables
- Repository structure - Flattened from subfolder to root

### Files Created
- `ROADMAP.md` - Project roadmap and milestone tracking
- `pm/actions/user_to-do.md` - Manual task tracking
- `pm/adr/ADR-TEMPLATE.md` - Template for architectural decisions
- `pm/summaries/sprint-001-project-setup.md` - This summary

## Next Sprint Planning

### Immediate Priorities
1. Initialize git repository with proper .gitignore
2. Set up core API structure
3. Implement basic health endpoints
4. Configure authentication system

### Pending Tasks
- Git repository initialization
- Security configuration setup
- Core API development
- Testing framework setup

## Notes & Observations

- Project structure now follows PM documentation standards
- All sensitive configuration properly templated in .env.example
- Clear task tracking established for manual testing requirements
- Foundation ready for development phase
