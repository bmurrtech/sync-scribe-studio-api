```bash
# Install Python security tools
pip install safety bandit pip-audit semgrep

# Install Node.js security tools (in youtube-downloader service)
cd services/youtube-downloader
npm install -g snyk audit-ci
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY: Security Integration (Complete within 72 hours)

#### [ ] Flask Application Security Integration
**Add to app.py:**
```python
from security_utils import (
    initialize_security, security_headers, audit_logger,
    require_auth, rate_limit, security_health_check
)

# Initialize security at app startup
initialize_security()

# Add security headers to all responses
@app.after_request
def add_security_headers(response):
    headers = security_headers.get_security_headers()
    for key, value in headers.items():
        response.headers[key] = value
    return response

# Add security health check endpoint
@app.route('/health/security')
def security_health():
    return security_health_check()
```

#### [ ] Protect Sensitive API Endpoints
```python
# Example: Protect YouTube downloader endpoints
@app.route('/api/youtube/download')
@require_auth
@rate_limit(limit=10, window=60)  # 10 requests per minute
def youtube_download():
    # Your existing endpoint logic
    pass
```

#### [ ] Manual Security Testing
**Create and run these security tests:**
```bash
# Test authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/protected-endpoint
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token" http://localhost:8000/api/protected-endpoint
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized

curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $DB_TOKEN" http://localhost:8000/api/protected-endpoint
# Expected: 200 OK

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..101}; do curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/endpoint & done; wait
# Expected: Some requests return 429 Too Many Requests

# Test security headers
curl -I http://localhost:8000/

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  VALIDATION RESULTS - STEP 1 COMPLETED

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED: PRD_2, Cloud-Run & Rules Validation (January 2025)

#### ‚úÖ PRD_2 Analysis Results:
- **Objective**: ‚úÖ Local development & packaging for gated distribution confirmed
- **Functional Requirements**: ‚úÖ All requirements documented and aligned
- **Docker Support**: ‚úÖ Dockerfile and container configuration present
- **Health Endpoints**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic YouTube microservice health exists, main API needs enhancement
- **Local Testing**: ‚úÖ Build and run documentation available
- **Environment Variables**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive .env.example provided

#### üîç Cloud-Run Requirements Analysis:
**CRITICAL FINDINGS:**
- ‚ùå **PORT Environment Variable**: Main Flask app hardcoded to port 8080, should use `PORT` env var
- ‚ùå **Missing /health Endpoint**: Main API lacks basic health endpoint (rule BEW5 requirement)
- ‚ùå **Missing /health/detailed Endpoint**: No detailed health check with env vars status
- ‚ùå **Missing Root / Endpoint**: No service info endpoint with documentation links

#### üìã Active Project Rules Compliance:

**BEW5 (CRITICAL - MISSING):**
- ‚ùå Basic /health endpoint (service status, timestamp, version)
- ‚ùå /health/detailed endpoint (env vars, MCP status, dependencies)
- ‚ùå Root / endpoint (service info, endpoints, docs)

**ehpu1uReU* (Security Rules - PARTIAL):**
- ‚úÖ FastAPI HTTPBearer partially implemented in youtube service
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DB_TOKEN validation needs implementation in main Flask app
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limiting needs setup in main app
- ‚úÖ Security utilities module exists (security_utils.py)

**W2CSET* (Environment Variables - NEEDS ATTENTION):**
- ‚úÖ .env.example comprehensive and up-to-date
- ‚úÖ All mandatory variables present (PORT, DB_TOKEN, STAGING_RAILWAY_URL, PROD_RAILWAY_URL)
- ‚ùå Main Flask app not using PORT environment variable

#### üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:

1. **Fix PORT Environment Variable Usage**:
   ```python
   # In app.py line 204, change:
   # app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
   # To:
   app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080)))
   ```

2. **Implement Missing Health Endpoints** (BEW5 Rule):
   - Create `/health` endpoint returning service status, timestamp, version
   - Create `/health/detailed` endpoint with env vars presence, MCP status
   - Create root `/` endpoint with service info and documentation links

3. **Create Server Infrastructure Module**:
   - Create `/server/` directory with `health.py`, `security.py`, `mcpo_config.py`
   - Separate infrastructure code from business logic per rule y2w5A10bR4G3oGMhwLZcAs

#### üìä Environment Variables Status:
**‚úÖ VERIFIED in .env.example:**
- PORT=8000 (present but unused in main app)
- DB_TOKEN=your-api-token-here (present)
- STAGING_RAILWAY_URL=https://your-staging-url.up.railway.app (present)
- PROD_RAILWAY_URL=https://your-production-url.up.railway.app (present)

**Additional Required Variables Found:**
- OPENAI_API_KEY (for AI features)
- YOUTUBE_SERVICE_URL (microservice integration)
- Security configuration variables (rate limiting, CORS, etc.)

### üìù NEXT STEPS - HIGH PRIORITY:
